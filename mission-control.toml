objective = "Add structured traceability logging to the worker system so operators can trace exactly what each worker does during a mission. Add a new src/mission_control/tracing.py module that defines a TraceEvent dataclass (timestamp, worker_id, unit_id, event_type, details) and a TraceLogger class that writes JSON-lines to a configurable trace file. Instrument the key worker lifecycle points: (1) worker spawn/claim, (2) Claude session start/end with prompt summary, (3) git operations (branch create, commit, push), (4) merge attempt and result, (5) fixup attempts and outcomes. Add a [tracing] section to the config with enabled/path/max_file_size fields. Add a CLI subcommand `mc trace` that reads a trace file and prints a human-readable timeline. Include tests for TraceLogger and TraceEvent serialization. Wire the tracer into continuous_controller.py and worker.py at the instrumentation points."
